This package is not compatible with [CircleDI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CircleDI) (this package already includes it).


## Requirements

- Language Version C#12 (default of .NET 8)
  - if you are using an older TargetFramework:
    - **.NET**
    => just set the language version to at least C#12.
    - **.NET Standard 2.1**
    => together with the LangVersion requirement you also need some polyfills, I recommend using [PolySharp](https://github.com/Sergio0694/PolySharp).
    - **.NET Framework, UWP, .NET Standard 2.0**
    => LangVersion C#12 or newer, polyfills ([PolySharp](https://github.com/Sergio0694/PolySharp)) and disable DisposeAsync generation.
